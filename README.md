# üåü MetaCognify

**Hackathon:** Falcon Hackathon by lablab.ai
**Team:** The Falconers

## üöÄ Introduction

Created during the 10-day Falcon Hackathon, MetaCognify is an innovative solution dedicated to the education sector. Our project's main goal is to provide students AI-powered methods to strengthen their critical thinking skills and memory.

MetaCognify utilises the advanced Falcon 180B model to analyze and evaluate student performance. MetaCognify provides two transformative methods: the Feynman Technique and the Socratic Method. These methods, backed by psychological research, are known to significantly enhance critical thinking skills. MetaCognify offers an AI simulation of these methods to boost critical thinking and knowledge retention.

## Basic Idea About the Self-Study Techniques

- The Feynman Technique: Named after the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman, this method involves explaining a concept in simple terms as if teaching it to a beginner. It helps identify gaps in understanding and reinforces knowledge through simplification and analogy. Feynman was renowned for his ability to break down complex topics into understandable pieces, making this technique a powerful tool for deep learning.

- The Socratic Method: Originating from the classical Greek philosopher Socrates, this approach uses a taxonomy of guided questions to stimulate critical thinking and illuminate ideas. By continually asking "why" and "how," it challenges assumptions and deepens understanding. Socrates employed this technique to engage his students in dialogue, encouraging them to think deeply and question their own beliefs.

## üéØ Features

- **AI Simulation of the Feynman Technique 1**:Engage with an AI beginner bot named Noobert, which like its name, acts as a beginner! It prompts you to explain complex concepts in simple terms, boosting deeper understanding of your chosen topic and increases knowledge retention.
- **AI-Powered Socratic Method**: Interact with AI-driven Socratic dialogues that challenge your reasoning and encourage critical thinking by answering probing questions designed by Socrabot, an AI chatbot designed to perform Socratic questioning.
- **Performance Metrics and Detailed Feedback**: Both Noobert and Socrabot have the ability to provide feedback on how well you did on the chosen topic - insightful analytics and personalized feedback on your explanations, highlighting areas of strength and opportunities for improvement.
