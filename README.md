# üåü MetaCognify

**Hackathon:** Falcon Hackathon by lablab.ai  
**Team:** The Falconers

## üöÄ Introduction

MetaCognify is an educational tool developed during the 10-day Falcon Hackathon. It leverages the Falcon 180B model to help students improve critical thinking and memory. The platform offers AI-driven simulations of the Feynman Technique and the Socratic Method, which are effective strategies for enhancing cognitive skills.

## Self-Study Techniques

- **Feynman Technique:** Simplify complex concepts as if teaching a beginner. This method helps in identifying gaps in understanding and reinforcing knowledge through simplification and analogy.

- **Socratic Method:** Engage in guided questioning to challenge assumptions and deepen comprehension. By asking "why" and "how," this technique stimulates critical thinking and encourages deeper exploration of ideas.

## üéØ Features

- **Noobert:** An AI bot that simulates the Feynman Technique. It prompts users to explain topics in simple terms, enhancing understanding and retention.
- **Socrabot:** An AI bot that employs the Socratic Method. It challenges users with probing questions, promoting critical thinking and reflection.
- **Feedback & Analytics:** Provides detailed performance metrics and personalized feedback, highlighting strengths and areas for improvement.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Next.js, TypeScript
- **API:** OpenAI
